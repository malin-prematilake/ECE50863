Crypto curreency mining


How to id spam

one class classification: classificaiton done in server, based on some data set, classificaiton
not customized to user network. this classificaiton is done in iot devices (sort of)

why this is bad: updated device firmware can change the traffic pattern
we need to look into the source/dest of traffic as well to decide a threat (it can )

=======================================================================
Our target:

Identify threats, based on the following models
	botnet attacks
	data snooping
	type of packets: Like icmp, ping of death, http flood, udp flood, syn flood...
	
clustering
