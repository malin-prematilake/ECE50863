we can use this the unsw work as the basis and build something on top of that, with more capabilities in detecting data
we can do:
	see if inside data is going to the outside
	some one is accessing our devices without permission
	what if attacks are done based on the MUD profile (attack during an off peak hour)
	see the status of the ports: blocked, any new ones open
	this paper says nothing about illegal use of devices' computational power (eg: crypto mining):IP or MAC spoofing can hide the IP so that it 
		cannot be seen from MUD profiling (what if an infected device impersonates other devices and does the same thing)
	focus several   attacking one server (e.g. instead of one device sending 100 pkts a second, 10 devices send 10 pkts per second, where 10 pkts/s 
		is considered not dangerous)
	brute force attacks on trying to access (this still goes through the router)
	most attacks are detected, not identified: identifying can lead to more effective blocking
	
MUD files
	
for that we need more insight into the data

packet(row['Packet ID'], row['TIME'], row['Size'], row['eth.src'], row['eth.dst'], 
row['IP.src'], row['IP.dst'], row['IP.proto'], row['port.src'], row['port.dst'])

use eth src as device id

per device time vs data

use eth.src and eth.dst to identify incoming and outgoing traffic

group by device: 
	time vs data: tells the peak and off peak hours of data: local and internet traffic--over a week, over a month
	ip.dst vs data: 
	(outgoing)ip.dst vs number of times it is accessed in a unit time: 
	(incoming)ip.src vs number of times it is accessed in a unit time:
