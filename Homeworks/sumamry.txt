video streaming is very improtant today
will increase the amount of traffic in the future
users expect higher quality

questions asked in this paper
	how much does quality matter to user engagement
	different metrics affect differently to user enegagement
	can we use same metric acroos diffetnet platforms
	
critieria for maesuring
	qualiyt matric:  encodling, bufferig experienced, 
	time scales of user engagement
	types of video content

collecting data
data collecting system has 2 parts
	client resident instrumentation library
	data aggeragation and processing side running on the positive side

collect and process data affliated over a wide variety of end users, video content, isp, content delivery networks

----------------------------------------------------------
engagement metrics
describes user involvement and interaction
	view level: single view is a user viewwing a single video continously 
	viewer level: experience of a single viewer (aka tool) : # of viewers per viewer and total play time of all videos in that viewer
-----------------------------------------------------------
video quality metrics
join time
buffering ratio
rate of bufffering events
average bit rate
rendering quality
---------------------------------------------------------
dataset
collected data classified into 3 categories
diverse providers are chosen to eliminate any biases

longVoD: length between 35-60
shortVoD: 2-5 mins
Live: special bcz client buffers are designed so that viewer lag is no more than few secnods from the original
		all viewers are roughly synced in time

ANALYSIS
an overview of the results show that while most of the viewing sessions are enjoying good quality, there is a non-negligible number of 
views that suffer from quality issues. hence content providers must take action to improve user experience and increase user engagement

to do this we need to understand which matrics matter the most, relationships between quality metrics and engagement, how to quantify the
importance of a metric, try to explian some eceptional behaviors

quantify the magnitude and the direction of a relationship between the engagement metric and quality metrics using kendall correlation
this lets us understand if and how the quality impacts user engagement

---------------------------------------------------------
after using correlation, use information gain to understand if a pair of metrics 
are complementary or if they capture the same effect, and to identify the top 
metrics that should be improved to increase user engagement
infor gain provides more of an in depth analysis of the interaction between the 
quality metrics
------------------------------------------------------------
regression is used to identify theexpected improvement in egagement if a specific 
quality metric is improved by a given amount

view level engagement
We find that BufRatio has the highest engagement among all quality mterics
relative impact of other quality metrics depend on the content ytpe

Long VoD content
Bufratio has the highest correlation with play time
jointime and avgbitrate has very low correlation 

infogain for bufratio is low
ratebuf has higher info gain, same true for avgbitrate

when we combine other mterics with avgbitrate, it provides the highest bivariate info gain. 

combinations of bufration, ratebuf and randqual had strong correlations, but their combinations do not add any new info
