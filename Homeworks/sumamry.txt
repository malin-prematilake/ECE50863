diverse providers are chosen to eliminate any biases

longVoD: length between 35-60
shortVoD: 2-5 mins
Live: special bcz client buffers are designed so that viewer lag is no more than few secnods from the original

ANALYSIS
an overview of the results show that while most of the viewing sessions are enjoying good quality, there is a non-negligible number of 
views that suffer from quality issues. hence content providers must take action to improve user experience and increase user engagement

to do this we need to understand which matrics matter the most, relationships between quality metrics and engagement, how to quantify the
importance of a metric, try to explian some eceptional behaviors
